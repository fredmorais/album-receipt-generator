Hello world!

My name is Frederico Morais and this is my final CS50 project!

The idea came when searching through Instagram and seeing this particular profile: https://www.instagram.com/albumreceipts/

I thought the idea was pretty cool and decided to give it a go automating it using Python. I also intended to automatically upload it to an Instagram account but the API does not allow that.

To run the program just execute python3 generate.py and follow the steps that appear on the command line.

I hope you enjoy my project! All the credits for the idea go to the original Instagram account creator.

Thank you CS50 for one of the best courses of my life! Cheers from Portugal
